Files I find useful to keep available for use with the game Star Citizen.

Of primary interest of course, are my control mapping files, which evolve slowly over time as my preferences, physical hardware, and the game itself changes.

For utility purposes, I have some scripts to copy layout scripts between project directories and the game.  They currently take a little manual tweaking since there are hard-coded values inside.

I've also started to track Voice Attack controls here as well.  I tried changing machines and having to do that was a pain point.  I'm rebuilding that from scratch and expect it to grow in the near future.
